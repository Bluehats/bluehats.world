## üèõÔ∏è Free Software in, by and for the public sector

Free Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and
improve software. BlueHats is a worldwide community of public servants
(teachers, researchers and other government workers, etc.) who promote
Free and Open Source software in, by and for the public sector.
BlueHats believe that taxes should go to Free Software and support the
principle of "public money, public code".
